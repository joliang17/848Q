                      passed 15 constitutional amendments called the Social Guarantees, and
                      the Alien Property Law, which allowed its government to seize German
                      and Italian property after a German submarine attack. Earlier, this
                      country was alternately ruled by men called Don Ricardo and Don Cleto.
                      The assassination of communist Mora Valverde, who led the People's

                      Edward Titchener. This author of Principles of Physiological

                      Levels of this element in cells can be measured using aequorin. This
                      element regulates the binding of phospholipids to annexins. This

                      diacylglycerol, this element activates protein kinase C. Parvalbumin
                      contains three helix-loop-helix domains which bind to this element.
                      Levels of this element in serum can be reduced by a hormone produced
