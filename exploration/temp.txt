                      passed 15 constitutional amendments called the Social Guarantees, and
                      the Alien Property Law, which allowed its government to seize German
                      and Italian property after a German submarine attack. Earlier, this
                      country was alternately ruled by men called Don Ricardo and Don Cleto.
                      The assassination of communist Mora Valverde, who led the People's

                      created a theory where the objects of "apprehension" must be focalized
                      using the process of "apperception." Following the work of Donders,
                      this man measured how long it takes to differentiate two stimuli, as
                      part of his extensive experiments on reaction time. This man
                      originated the method of "introspection" as part of his psychology of
                      "voluntarism," contrasted with the "structuralism" of his student
                      Edward Titchener. This author of Principles of Physiological

                      which leads to a carpal spasm called the "hand of the obstetrician."
                      Levels of this element in cells can be measured using aequorin. This
                      element regulates the binding of phospholipids to annexins. This
                      element can become deficient in the blood of patients with many blood

                      diacylglycerol, this element activates protein kinase C. Parvalbumin
                      contains three helix-loop-helix domains which bind to this element.
                      Levels of this element in serum can be reduced by a hormone produced
                      by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland or raised by
                      parathyroid hormone. This element binds to troponin, which allows
