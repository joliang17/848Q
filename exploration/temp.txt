                      impressions as tourists in the "Prague Project." The desert, sea waves

                      hourglass, a candle, and a calendar titled Wheel of Fortune. Another

                text: The Wigner D-matrices can be expanded simply in terms of these
                      functions. The fact that the sum of the squares of a subset of these
                      functions equals a constant is used to prove Unsold's theorem.
                      Applying the spin-raising operator to these functions yields their
                      "spin-weighted" counterparts. Multiplying these functions by a factor
                      of "r raised to the l" yields their "solid" counterparts. The simplest
                      of these functions equals one over the square root of 4 pi. These
                      functions of two variables can be reduced to functions of one variable
                      by converting them to their associated Legendre polynomials. They are
                      the eigenfunctions of the operators for the z-component of angular

                      of the reactants according to the Fuoss-Eigen equation. That rate
                      constant arises from the Eigen-Wilkins mechanism, which describes this
                      kind of reaction. In square planar complexes, the rate of this kind of
                      reaction can be enhanced by the presence of a strong sigma donor
                      ligand on the other side of the complex in the trans effect. This type
                      of reaction can take place via associative or interchange mechanisms.

                      theory of this phenomenon, one of whose components is commitment, was
                      developed by Robert Sternberg. Rollo May suggested that this concept

                text: One parameter characterizing this phenomenon is the fragility index,
                      which is the slope of an Angell plot. One theory describing this
                      phenomenon states it takes place when the configurational entropy is
                      zero, while another theory states it occurs at a precise value of the
                      free volume. The Gibbs-DiMarzio theory describes this phenomenon.
                      Extrapolating the entropy curve for this phenomenon paradoxically
                      yields a zero change in entropy below a critical temperature, a result
                      derived by Kauzmann. The temperature dependence of viscosity in this
                      phenomenon can be measured by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation, the
                      Doolittle equation, or the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation. In general,
                      the temperature at which this process occurs tends to be low for an
                      elastomer and high for a thermoplastic. It's not

                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the

                      The second most common use of the antidepressant bupropion is
                      treatment of this disorder. The drugs cytisine and varenicline treat
                      this disorder by being partially agonistic to a type of receptor that
                      appears on both sides of the neuromuscular junction. The non-alpha 7
                      types of that receptor contribute to this disease by directly exciting
                      dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons. The compound most directly
                      responsible for this condition mimics the action of acetylcholine in
                      namesake acetylcholine receptors. The most common way to treat this

                      surroundings, which are a "fair-resting place" featuring a chorus of
                      cicadas, to a spot sacred to Achelous. Later, Socrates compares his
                      words to the epitaph of Midas's tomb, whose lines can be read in any
                      order because they do not succeed each other logically. A word that
                      can mean "potion", "remedy", or "poison" is the starting point for
                      Jacques Derrida's reading of this dialogue, titled "Plato's Pharmacy."
                      In this dialogue, Socrates uses the image of a charioteer attempting
                      to drive two winged horses of different qualities of stock

                text: As described in the book De Nugis Curialium, one of this man's most
                      loyal followers was questioned by Walter Map, and ridiculed when he
                      claimed that he believed in the mother of Christ, because it was not
                      proper to profess belief in a non-member of the Trinity. An anonymous
                      chronicle says this man repented his sins after hearing a sermon about
                      how St. Alexius died a blessed death, though the account of his
                      conversion by Stephen of Bourbon does not tell that story. He sent a
                      delegation to Pope Alexander III, who refused to legitimize his
                      teachings, which were shortly thereafter condemned at the Council of
                      Verona by Pope Lucius III. This man's followers were often called
                      Sabotiers or Insabbatati for their habit of wearing wooden shoes,
                      though they called themselves the "Poor Men of Lyon," and they
                      preached as peddlers in the Provencál dialect. For 10 points, name
                      this wealthy merchant who became a beggar, and founded a namesake

                text: In peptide bonds, one of these phenomena produces a well-characterized
                      signal designated "NV1." The intensity of these phenomena can be
                      increased by d-p mixing or vibronic coupling. CT complexes can undergo
                      LMCT or MLCT examples of these phenomena. In two types of diagrams
                      depicting these phenomena, lines become curved due to the non-crossing
                      rule. In one set of diagrams depicting the energies of these
                      phenomena, both axes are normalized by the Racah parameter. Examples
                      of this kind of process include intersystem crossing, where a
                      difference in spin multiplicity allows this kind of process to occur
                      in a non-radiative fashion. Sandwiching the electric dipole operator
                      between the initial and final state wavefunctions for this process can
                      be used to derive the fact that the azimuthal quantum number must
                      change by plus or minus one, or this process is said to be "forbidden"
                      according to a selection rule. For 10 points, name this process by
                      which a molecule's electrons change energy levels.

                text: Tunable examples of a type of these devices include the Berek
                      compensator and the Soleil-Babinet compensator. Spatial hole burning
                      in continuous wave lasers can be avoided by placing two of these
                      devices on either side of the gain medium, a process called a
                      "twisted-mode technique." An alternative to one type of these devices
                      is the Fresnel rhomb. The amount of retardation is a multiple of two
                      pi larger in a "multiple-order" one of these devices than in a "zero-
                      order" one of these devices. In one type of these devices, the waves
                      propagating parallel to the "fast axis" acquire a phase shift of pi
                      over 2 with respect to waves propagating parallel to the "slow axis,"
                      because the index of refraction is split into "ordinary" and
                      "extraordinary" components. A birefringent crystal which converts
                      linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light is an example
                      of, for 10 points, what type of

                text: A 2004 experiment used the decay of these particles to confirm the
                      Standard Model's prediction that the Michel rho param- eter equals
                      0.75; that experiment, which confirms the V-A structure of the weak
                      force, was done by the TWIST collaboration. This particle's decay is
                      also used to measure the Fermi constant characterizing the strength of
                      the weak force. Because these particles are not stopped by
                      electromagnetic or hadronic calorimeters, the ATLAS and CMS
                      experiments have a separate spec- trometer solely for detection of
                      these particles. Charged pions decay into one of these particles and a
