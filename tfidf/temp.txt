                      language's vigesimal counting system as evidence that it is the
                      survivor of a far-reaching substratum. A classification of the
                      dialects of this language was created by Louis Lucien Bonaparte, who
                      argued that this language has a number of words for tools based on the
                      root word for "stone" in the so-called aizkora controversy. A "proto"
                      form of this language was reconstructed by Koldo Mitxelena.
                      Intransitive verbs in this language are conjugated with the irregular
                      verb izan. In the seventeenth century, a pidgin of this language was
                      brought by sailors from its homeland to Iceland. Dialects of this
                      language include Zuberoan and Gipuzkoan, while its standard form was

                      Mutations in the CD18 subunit of another of these pro- teins causes a
                      disease known as LAD-1. These proteins are the targets of drugs such
                      as abciximab, eptifibatide, and natalizumab. These proteins frequently
                      bind to the acidic RGD or LDV sequences of their ligands. The kinase
                      FAK mediates the signaling performed by these proteins, which bind to
                      filamin and talin at their cytoplasmic faces. The alpha-A domain of
                      one of these proteins is homologous to the A-domain of von Willenbrand
                      factor. The binding of divalent cations to these heterodimeric
                      proteins allows them to bind to ligands such as VCAMs and ICAMs. One
                      of these proteins designated "alpha-6 beta-1" binds to laminin while
                      one designated "alpha-5 beta-1" binds to fibronectin. They are similar
                      to selectins and cadherins. For 10 points, name these transmembrane

                      rewritten with the assumption that the potential only includes
                      pairwise interactions - that technique is called Mayer cluster
                      expansion. A common technique used to solve the Ising model is to
                      express this quantity as the trace of a product of transfer matrices.
                      This quantity can be obtained via a path integral of the Euclidean
                      action, which can be shown by Wick rotating the path integral used to
                      obtain the propagator. For a system of N indistinguishable particles,
                      the total value for this quantity equals one individual particle's
                      value for this quantity raised to the N power divided by N factorial.
