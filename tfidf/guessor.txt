                text: A fictional character in this country rips out a doll's blonde hair
                      and replaces it with horsehair. A novel set in this country imitates
                      the Jerilderie letter by using no commas for the narration. In another
                      novel set in this country, the title characters are described as "one
                      obsessive, one compulsive" in their gambling, and their rivalry leads
                      to a glass church being floated down a river to Bellingen. In a novel
                      set in this country, a shootout at the Glenrowan Hotel leads to the
                      capture of the steel-armored protagonist. For 10 points, name this
                      country that is the setting of Oscar and Lucinda and The True History
                      of the Kelly Gang, the home of Peter Carey and Patrick White.

                text: This text defines a state of "inclosing reserve" that may manifest
                      itself in a tyrant that needs a confidant who will be killed after he
                      is used. In examining how the "lack of possibility" contributes to the
                      title phenomenon, it compares a foolish determinist to King Midas and
                      the fatalist to a man who has no possibility to breathe. This book's
                      second portion considers the Socratic definition of ignorance to ask
                      whether men are aware of the title phenomenon. Its first part defines
                      the human being as "spirit" and notes that "the self is not the
                      relation but the relation's relating to itself." The title of this
                      work comes from a scene in which Jesus speaks to Lazarus after he is
                      raised from the dead. The commentator in this work suggests that
                      Christians enter a state of sin since they have not aligned themselves
                      with God. For 10 points, name this tract written by Anti-Climacus,
                      a.k.a. Kierkegaard, that equates despair with the title condition.

                text: If the trajectory of a photon travelling in a material possesses this
                      property, the photon can constructively self-interfere via coherent
                      backscattering. For Stokes flow, a swimmer whose swimming motion
                      possesses this property will not achieve propulsion according to the
                      scallop theorem. The surface states of topological insulators are
                      protected by conservation of particle number and this property. All
                      spin-1/2 eigenstates of a Hamiltonian with it must be at least doubly-
                      degenerate according to Kramers' theorem. Applying the antiunitary
                      operator associated with this property to the neutron causes a change
                      in its spin, but no change in its electric dipole moment. The
                      incompatibility between systems whose microscopic dynamics possess it
                      and the second law of thermodynamics is described by Loschmidt's
                      paradox. The combination of charge conjugation and parity inversion
                      with this symmetry is an exact symmetry of all particle interactions

                      concerto grosso into a series of three consecutive symphonies titled
                      Le matin, Le midi, and Le soir. In a G major symphony by this
                      composer, the Allegretto second movement introduces an ensemble of
                      triangle, cymbals, and bass drum to imitate Turkish Janissary bands.
                      For the EsterhÃ¡zy family, this composer wrote a symphony that ends
                      with all but two violins leaving the stage. In the second movement of
                      this composer's Symphony No. 94, the quiet opening theme is
                      interrupted by a sudden loud chord. For 10 points, name this composer

                      insisted on being beheaded rather than joining this dynasty. An early

                      displacement. Because of this, their propagation obeys the continuity
                      equation for incompressible media, and they cause no changes in

                      with a low-velocity surface zone. These waves cannot cross the

                      dotted with this function of the fluid velocity gives the convective
                      acceleration. Performing a gauge transformation of the vector
                      potential is done by adding this function of the gauge function to the

                text: With Milton Blum, this thinker wrote a book using a "tough shit"
                      approach about business called Executive Leadership. He coined the
                      terms "awfulizing," and "catastrophizing" to describe behavior that
                      should be fought with shame-attack exercises. He called the harmful
                      act of imposing absolute values on the world "musturbation." Many of
                      his ideas, such as the distinction between "discomfort disturbances"
                      and "ego disturbances," were developed while he writing Sex Without
                      Guilt and The Art and Science of Love. This thinker developed a model
                      of causation in which an activating event induces a belief, which
                      itself is responsible for a human feeling - that is the "ABC" model.
                      Like Aaron Beck, this psychologist developed an individualist approach
                      that seeks to correct harmful behavior by converting socially

                text: In 1963, John Stacey Adams put forth an "equity theory" of this
                      phenomenon, which focuses on creating a balance between inputs and
                      outputs. Philip Zimbardo's book on the "cognitive control" of this
                      factor, discusses consequences of choice and dissonance. A formula
                      that includes valence and instrumentality is known as Victor Vroom's
                      expectancy theory of this trait. Another theory states that "hygiene
                      factors" will not increase this value, but can decrease it if they are
                      absent, unlike "intrinsic factors" - that is Frederick Herzberg's two-
                      factor theory of this trait. Clark Hull posited that it arises in
                      humans as a result of tension or arousal caused by unfulfilled
                      biological needs; that is known as the "drive reduction theory" of
                      this quality. Its "deficiency" or "D" type is said to occur when one

                      systems with dimension greater than two in papers by Plancherel and
                      Rosenthal. Birkhoff showed that this property is equivalent to a
                      system having no invariant proper subspaces, the condition of metric
                      transitivity. This condition is the weakest in a chain of systems with
                      the Bernoulli property, K property, and mixing, all of which imply
                      this condition. A computer simulation showed that this condition was
                      not present in a 1D lattice of anharmonic oscillators, a result which
                      surprised Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam. This condition does not exist on the
                      "invariant KAM tori," and it is a requirement for the equipartition
                      theorem to hold. A statement of this condition is that the time
                      average of an observable is equal to its ensemble average. For 10

                text: This process occurs in the tunica albuginea around the corpora
                      cavernosa in Peyronie's disease. Myofibroblasts contribute to this
                      process when they fail to disappear from granulation tissue via
                      apoptosis. In this process, proteins are oriented parallel to each
                      other rather than being oriented perpendicular to each other in the
                      proper "basket-weave" manner. This process can produce both
                      "hypertrophic" products and keloids. It's not inflammation, but the
                      muscle of the heart undergoes this process after a myocardial
                      infarction, and the tissues of the liver undergo this process in
                      patients with cirrhosis. For 10 points, name this process in which
                      excess connective tissue accumulates in response to events like
                      injuries to the skin.

                text: This man's attempt at securing restitution of the lost property of
                      some hostages led another politician to compare him to Ulysses, who
                      wanted to re-enter the cave of the Cyclops to fetch his belt and cap.
                      He included a diatribe against Timaeus of Tauromenium in a treatise
                      that relies on Timaeus for his account of Sicily. Late in life, he
                      accompanied a general to Spain and witnessed the Numantine War, on
                      which he wrote a now-lost monograph. In Book IV of his surviving work,
                      he describes the structure of the Roman maniples, which is why the
                      Roman army is sometimes named for him. In his early life, this
                      Arcadian citizen of the Achaean League was taken hostage by Rome and
                      made a tutor to Scipio Aemilianus, who he accompanied during the sack
                      of Carthage. Only five out of forty volumes survive of his major work,
                      which describes the Roman Republic as a superpower. For 10 points,
                      name this second century B.C.E. Greek author of the Histories.
