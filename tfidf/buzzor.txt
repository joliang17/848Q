                      designed to a test a theory that features an equation that sets the
                      covariant wave operator equal to 8 pi times the stress energy tensor
                      divided by 3 plus two times this scientist's namesake coupling
                      constant. After he re-performed Loránd Eötvös's experiment to
                      confirm that inertial mass and gravitational mass were
                      indistinguishable, this man and an alphabetically prior colleague
                      developed a scalar-tensor alternative to general relativity For 10

                text: A pope with this name led an Italian league that fought off Saracen
                      pirates at the Battle of Ostia, and ordered the construction of a wall
                      around a namesake "City" that included the Borgo and the Vatican.

                text: Complexes of bisoxazolines and these species can be used to induce
                      enantioselectivity into aldol and Mannich-type reactions. One method
                      to test the "strength" of these species adds a triethylphosphine oxide
                      probe followed by phosphorus-31 NMR analysis; that is the Gutmann-
                      Beckett method. The addition of these substances to acetals can
                      influence whether acetal substitution occurs by an SN1 or SN2
                      mechanism. These substances are needed to activate the carbonyl group
                      in the Sakurai reaction. These compounds typically catalyze an
                      electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction which alkylates or
                      acylates an aromatic ring. Friedel-Crafts reactions can be catalyzed
                      by aluminum chloride or boron trifluoride,
